# Jupyter Notebooks

This directory will store:

* unpolished exploratory data analysis (EDA) notebooks; and
* a polished notebook that states the business problem and summarizes your solution, along with high level takeaways.

Note: We could not include the shapefile as it was too large but here is a link on how to download it. https://usa.ipums.org/usa/volii/boundaries.shtml it is the very first download link labeled "2010 PUMAS"

## Naming Convention

Naming convention is:

* a number (for ordering);
* the creator's initials; and 
a short `_` delimited description

Example is: `01_erh_download_and_explore_data.ipynb`
